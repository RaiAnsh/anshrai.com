      <p>
        I’m a third-year Computer Science student with a minor in Human Resources, focused on building modern web applications. I have experience working directly with clients, delivering projects end-to-end from initial concept through design and deployment. My coursework includes computer security, database systems, data structures, and operating systems, providing a strong technical foundation. I combine software development skills with an understanding of design, usability, and communication to build practical, user-focused solutions.
